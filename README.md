## üíª Setup Guide  

Follow these steps to contribute to the project:

### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository  

Make a fork of the repository and clone it to your machine:

```bash
# Original Repository
https://github.com/wodoame/expense-tracking-application.git

# Your Fork
git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/expense-tracking-application.git
```

### 2. Set Up a Python Virtual Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment for the project:

```bash
# Create the virtual environment
python3 -m venv etavenv

# Activate it
# For Linux/Mac:
source etavenv/bin/activate

# For Windows:
etavenv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

#Note: If you encounter issues with psycopg2, install psycopg2-binary instead
pip install psycopg2-binary

or run this command

pip install requirements-psycopg2-binary.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the root directory and add the Django secret key:

```bash
cd expense-tracking-application
vi .env

#add the following line to the .env file
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
ENCRYPTION_KEY=KfqlGQW_Y5OthQf2aSY0a6ujeOlRXB8USrlMPfzV8J4= # this is a sample key


```

Or generate an encryption key using the following procedure

```python
    from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
    key = Fernet.generate_key()
    print(key) #print to acces the key and save in the .env

```

Save and exit the file.

*NOTE: A secret key is generated for you already so it's not necessary to generate one yourself*
You can generate a secret key like this

```python
  from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key
  get_random_secret_key()

  # If you wish to store the secret key in your .env file you can print and copy the output of get_random_secret_key()
```

### 5. Apply Migrations

Run Django migrations to set up the SQLite database:

```bash
cd expense-tracking-application/expense-tracking-app
python manage.py migrate
```

### 6. Start the Development Server

Run the server to view and contribute to the application:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### 7. Contribute

Make your changes or add a new feature.
Commit your updates and push them to your forked repository.
Create a pull request to the main repository for review.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
git push origin your-branch-name
```

Once your PR is reviewed, necessary steps will be taken to integrate your contributions. üéâ
